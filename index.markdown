<p>Iâ€™m Will, a final-year PhD student in Cognitive Science. I study the cognitive processes underlying our ability to build things, with the aim of developing technology to complement and extend this ability. </p>

<p> My experimental work explores a wide range of generative behaviors (e.g. block building, drawing, computer aided design, language) to demonstrate the strengths and limitations of human cognition as applied to creative domains. My computational work tests specific hypotheses about the format of mental representations that support such tasks, particularly when we collaborate with others. My hope is that by understanding how human cognition interfaces with the world, we can design AI systems that dovetail with our strengths and complement our weaknesses. </p>

<!-- 
<p>I use tools from computational cognitive psychology to explore how we might leverage the complementary strengths of human intelligence and AI. My experimental work has explored a range of generative behaviors (e.g. block building, drawing, computer aided design) to demonstrate the strengths and limitations of our ability to create. I also create computational models to test hypotheses about how we learn in these settings, and demonstrate that we build (and think) in different ways from AI algorithms.</p> -->

<!-- ### research
How do perception, action, and communication constrain each other to support abstract reasoning?
Using physical construction as a case study, I have explored [how we learn to make things](https://github.com/cogtoolslab/block_construction), [how collaborators end up sharing words for things](https://github.com/cogtoolslab/compositional-abstractions), and am currently investigating whether making changes how we see the world.
I'm inspired by theories of cognition that emphasize the continuity between our minds, bodies, and environments, and see my work as building on these ideas using computational models and large-scale online experiments. -->


### bio

I grew up in Somerset, a grassy county in the southwest of England.
After seriously considering a career in art and design, I eventually left the shire to study Computer Science and Philosophy at Oxford.
Inspired by approaches to cognition that emphasized our relation to the world, I decided to pursue Cognitive Science, and joined the eclectic department at UCSD, where I am now in the final year of my PhD.
