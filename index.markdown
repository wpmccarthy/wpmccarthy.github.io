<p>Iâ€™m a PhD Student in Cognitive Science. I believe that the act of making things has a profound impact on how we view the world, and in my research I use the tools of cognitive science to see whether this is true.</p>

<p>To do this I run online experiments where people build things, and design computational models that let us test hypothesis about their mental representations. I hope that by understanding how people learn to make things, we can design technology that makes it easier for people to create.</p>

<!-- ### research
How do perception, action, and communication constrain each other to support abstract reasoning?
Using physical construction as a case study, I have explored [how we learn to make things](https://github.com/cogtoolslab/block_construction), [how collaborators end up sharing words for things](https://github.com/cogtoolslab/compositional-abstractions), and am currently investigating whether making changes how we see the world.
I'm inspired by theories of cognition that emphasize the continuity between our minds, bodies, and environments, and see my work as building on these ideas using computational models and large-scale online experiments. -->


### bio

I grew up in Somerset, a grassy county in the southwest of England.
Despite being tempted by a career in art, I eventually left the shire to study Computer Science and Philosophy at Oxford.
Inspired by approaches to cognition that emphasized our relation to the world, I decided to pursue Cognitive Science, and joined the eclectic department at UCSD, where I am now in the 4th year of my PhD.
