### hello

I'm a PhD student in Cognitive Science at UC San Diego, working with David Kirsh and [Judy Fan](https://cogtoolslab.github.io/).

I study how people construct visual worlds, both internally and externally, in order to understand complex problems.

### bio

I grew up in Somerset, England. I studied Computer Science and Philosophy at Oxford, and then moved to San Diego for a PhD in Cognitive Science.
