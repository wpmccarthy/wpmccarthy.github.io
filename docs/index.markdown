Hello! I'm a PhD student in Cognitive Science at UC San Diego, working with David Kirsh and [Judy Fan](https://cogtoolslab.github.io/).

I study how people construct visual worlds, both internally and externally, in order to understand complex problems.

### bio

I grew up in Somerset, a grassy county in the south west of England.
In search of wisdom and adventure, I left the shire to study Computer Science and Philosophy at Oxford, then moved to San Diego to start a PhD in Cognitive Science.
So far it has been an adventure.
