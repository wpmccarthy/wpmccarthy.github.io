I'm a PhD student in Cognitive Science at UC San Diego, working with Judy Fan and David Kirsh.
I study the [cognitive tools](https://cogtoolslab.github.io/) that underlie our ability to create new things.
As well as shed light on how we convert ideas into physical stuff, I hope that my research can be used to engineer more organic relationships between humans and creative machines.

### research

I'm inspired by theories of cognition that emphasize the continuity between our minds, bodies, and environments, and see my work partly as a development of these ideas into a more computational framework. 
Most recently, I explored [how our ability to build something changes with practice](https://github.com/cogtoolslab/block_construction), and am currently investigating how mental simulation and perception interact during the building process.


### bio

I grew up in Somerset, a grassy county in the southwest of England.
I was tempted by a career in art, but eventually left the shire to study Computer Science and Philosophy at Oxford.
As a serial generalist, I became attracted to the field(s) of Cognitive Science, in particular the eclectic department at UCSD, where I am now in the 2nd year of my PhD.
