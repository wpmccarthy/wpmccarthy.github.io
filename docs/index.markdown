### hello

I'm a PhD student in Cognitive Science at UC San Diego, working with David Kirsh and [Judy Fan](https://cogtoolslab.github.io/).

I study how people construct visual worlds, both internally and externally, in order to understand complex problems.

### bio

I grew up in Somerset, England. I studied Computer Science and Philosophy at Oxford, and then moved to the US to start a PhD in Cognitive Science.

<!-- 
I flirted with the idea of art school, but decided that ideas needed to go into my brain before anything meaningful would come out. I studied computer science and philosophy at Oxford, and discovered that minds exist (sort of). I thought that studying them would be cool, so moved to the US to start a PhD in cognitive science. -->
